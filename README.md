# Part number Converter

I needed something that can take a group (or single item) separated by a carriage
return and return their coresponding values. This will work with anything that uses
a python dictionary. Or has keys and values.

When running for the first time a .json filed titled 'batch_db.json' with contents {}
will need to created and saved into same folder. This should be included with the repo.

Clicking the okay button after values are returned will copy contents to clipboard.
